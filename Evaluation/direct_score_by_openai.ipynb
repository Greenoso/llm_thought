In this case, we know that each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. We also know that there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets. Using basic arithmetic, we can set up an equation based on these facts and solve it to determine how many baskets there are.\\nIn summary, we use step-by-step thinking to break down the problem into smaller parts, identify what we know and don't know, and ultimately find the solution.

We need to use basic arithmetic operations to find the difference. First, we identify the initial quantity of regular soda and the additional quantity of diet soda. Then, we subtract the initial quantity of regular soda from the additional quantity of diet soda to get the desired answer. Finally, we provide the answer as the difference between the two quantities.',\n",
