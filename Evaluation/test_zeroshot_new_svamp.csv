Thoughts:[/INST]",Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
1. Let's start by identifying the given information:
* Mary has already added 5 cups of flour.
* The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour.
* The recipe also calls for 8 cups of sugar.
* The recipe calls for 7 cups of salt.
2. Now, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add than cups of salt. Let's do this by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed:
6 cups of flour - 5 cups of flour = 1 cup of flour left to add.
3. Since the recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar, and Mary has already added 5 cups of flour, she needs to add 3 more cups of sugar (8 - 5 = 3).
4. Now, let's find out how many more cups of salt Mary needs to add than cups of sugar she needs to add:
7 cups of salt - 3 cups of sugar = 4 cups of salt left to add.
5. Therefore, Mary needs to add 4 cups of salt.
Answer: 4 cups of salt.",4,1.0

Thoughts:[/INST]",Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?,"
Thoughts:
Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* Paul got a box of crayons for his birthday.
* He gave 52 crayons to his friends.
* He lost 535 crayons.
* He now has 492 crayons left.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many crayons had been lost or given away:
* If Paul had 500 crayons at first (including the ones he got for his birthday), and he gave away 52 crayons, then he had 448 crayons left (500 - 52 = 448).
* If he lost 535 crayons, then he had 93 crayons left (448 - 535 = 93).
* So, Paul had 93 crayons left after losing 535 crayons.

If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. We know that 419 visitors came on the previous day, so let's call that number ""x"".
Now, we need to find out how many visitors came to the palace on the day before that. We know that Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the palace that day, so let's call that number ""y"".
We can set up an equation based on the information given in the question:
x + y = 92
Now, we need to solve for ""x"" to find out how many visitors came to the palace on the day before the day Rachel visited.
x + y = 92
x = 419 - y

So, the number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace before the day Rachel visited is:
x = 419 - y

Answer:
The number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace before the day Rachel visited is 419 - y.",419,522.0

Thoughts:
Let's start by looking at the information given in the question:
* The Razorback shop makes $192 dollars off each t-shirt.
* The Razorback shop makes $34 dollars off each jersey.
* They sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.
Now, let's try to find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey:
Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from t-shirts and jerseys sold during the game.
Total revenue = Number of t-shirts x Price of t-shirt + Number of jerseys x Price of jersey
Total revenue = 157 t-shirts x $192 = $29,344 + 19 jerseys x $34 = $656
Step 2: Calculate the difference between the total revenue from t-shirts and jerseys.
Difference = Total revenue from t-shirts - Total revenue from jerseys
Difference = $29,344 - $656 = $28,688
Step 3: Divide the difference by the number of t-shirts sold to find the average price of a t-shirt.
Average price of t-shirt = Difference / Number of t-shirts
Average price of t-shirt = $28,688 / 157 = $182
Step 4: Now, we can find the difference between the average price of a t-shirt and the price of a jersey.
Difference = Average price of t-shirt - Price of jersey
Difference = $182 - $34 = $148
Therefore, a t-shirt costs $148 more than a jersey.

Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
* Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many drums of grapes are filled per day. We know that 235 pickers fill 100 drums of raspberries per day, and 221 pickers fill 221 drums of grapes per day.
* Since grapes are more than raspberries, we can assume that more pickers are filling drums of grapes than raspberries. Let's assume that 3/4 of the pickers are filling drums of grapes, since grapes are more than raspberries.
* Now, let's find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day. If 3/4 of the pickers are filling drums of grapes, then the number of drums filled per day is 3/4 x 221 = 157 drums of grapes per day.
* Now, let's find out how many days it would take to fill 77 drums of grapes. We know that there are 77 days in total, so we can divide the number of drums to be filled by the number of days: 77 drums / 157 drums per day = 0.5 days.
* Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can convert the time to hours by dividing by 24: 0.5 days x 24 hours/day = 12 hours.
* Therefore, it would take 12 hours to fill 77 drums of grapes.

* Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase.
* She cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
* Now, there are 15 roses in the vase.
2. To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to subtract the number of roses she cut from the number of roses she threw away.
3. So, the difference between the number of roses thrown away and the number of roses cut from the garden is:
34 - 15 = 19
4. Therefore, Jessica threw away 19 more roses than she cut from her garden.

* Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	+ The length of Jesse's room is 7 feet.
	+ The size of the carpet Jesse needs is 14 square feet.
* Now, we need to use the formula for the width of a room to find the width of Jesse's room:
	+ The width of a room is equal to the length of the room divided by the size of the carpet.
	+ So, the width of Jesse's room is 7 feet / 14 square feet = X.
* Now, we need to simplify the equation:

Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
1. Let's start by using the information given in the question to find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. We know that there were 39 paintings in the palace and that 661 visitors came to the palace that day.
2. To find the total number of visitors, we can multiply the number of paintings by the number of visitors per painting. Since there are 39 paintings, if each painting has an average of 600 visitors (which is the number of visitors the previous day), then the total number of visitors to the palace on the day Rachel visited would be:
39 paintings x 600 visitors per painting = 23,400 visitors
3. Now, we are asked how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day. To find this, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day (600) from the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited (23,400).
4. Therefore, the answer to the question is:
23,400 - 600 = 17,400 more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day.

Thoughts:[/INST]",He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Step 1: Understand the question
The question is asking about the number of sacks of oranges that will be available after 51 days of harvest, based on the information that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them.
Step 2: Identify the relevant information
The relevant information in the question is the number of sacks harvested per day (74) and the number of sacks discarded per day (71).
Step 3: Calculate the total number of sacks harvested
To calculate the total number of sacks harvested, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days of harvest (51). So, the total number of sacks harvested is:
74 sacks/day x 51 days = 3644 sacks
Step 4: Calculate the total number of sacks discarded
To calculate the total number of sacks discarded, we need to multiply the number of sacks discarded per day by the number of days of harvest (51). So, the total number of sacks discarded is:
71 sacks/day x 51 days = 3611 sacks
Step 5: Find the total number of sacks available after 51 days of harvest
To find the total number of sacks available after 51 days of harvest, we need to subtract the total number of sacks discarded from the total number of sacks harvested. So, the total number of sacks available after 51 days of harvest is:
3644 sacks - 3611 sacks = 333 sacks
Answer: 333 sacks
Therefore, after 51 days of harvest, they will have 333 sacks of oranges available.",333,153.0

* The first chapter is 91 pages long, so it has 91 pages.
* The second chapter is 23 pages long, so it has 23 pages.
* The third chapter is 25 pages long, so it has 25 pages.

Now, let's subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter to find the difference:

91 pages - 23 pages = 68 pages

Later, there were 10 children altogether on the bus. So, the total number of children on the bus now is 2 + x + 10.
To find out how many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop, we need to subtract the initial number of children from the total number of children now:
Number of children now - Number of children initially = x + 10 - 2 = x + 8
So, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.

If 269 students suggested adding bacon 330 suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu and 76 suggested adding tomatoes How many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon?,"  Sure! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* 269 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.
* 330 students suggested adding mashed potatoes to the menu.
* 76 students suggested adding tomatoes to the menu.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon.
We know that the total number of students who suggested adding something to the menu is 269 + 330 + 76 = 675.
So, to find the difference between the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon, we can subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of students who suggested something:

There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?
Thoughts:[/INST]",There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	* Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet initially.
	* After visiting a supermarket and a showroom, 26 dollars were left in her wallet.
	* She spent 49 dollars at the showroom.
2. Now, let's think about how much she spent at the supermarket:
	* If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom, and there were 26 dollars left in her wallet after visiting the supermarket, then she must have spent some amount at the supermarket as well.
	* Let's call the amount she spent at the supermarket ""x"".
3. We know that the total amount she spent is 49 + x, since she spent 49 dollars at the showroom.
4. Now, let's try to find the value of ""x"" by using the information given in the question:
	* The total amount she spent = 49 + x
	* The amount she spent at the supermarket = x
	* The amount she had in her wallet initially = 106
	* The amount she had left after visiting the supermarket = 26
	* The amount she spent at the showroom = 49

By using these equations, we can solve for ""x"" and find that she spent 23 dollars at the supermarket.

How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by looking at the information given in the question:
* He found out that they harvest 44 sacks of ripe oranges and 25 sacks of unripe oranges per day.
* So, the total number of oranges harvested per day is 44 + 25 = 69 sacks.
* Now, we need to find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested than unripe oranges per day.
* To do this, we can divide the number of ripe oranges harvested (44) by the number of unripe oranges harvested (25).
* So, the number of more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges harvested per day is 44 / 25 = 1.76.
* Since we can't have a fraction of a sack, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which is 2.
* Therefore, there are 2 more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges harvested per day.

Thoughts:

1. Rebecca has a total of 11 eggs to split into groups of 2 eggs each.
2. To find out how many eggs Rebecca has, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group.
3. So, we divide 11 eggs by 2 eggs per group: 11 ÷ 2 = 5.5 groups.
4. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number: 5.5 groups = 6 groups.
5. Therefore, Rebecca has 6 groups of eggs, which means she has 6 x 2 = 12 eggs in total.

* Winter is almost here.
* Most animals are migrating to warmer countries.
* 27 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain.
* Initially, there were 41 bird families living near the mountain.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the question:

If 27 bird families migrated away for the winter, then the number of bird families left near the mountain is equal to the initial number of bird families minus the number of families that migrated away.
So, the answer is:

Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day in question. We know that 705 visitors came on that day, and we also know that there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that.
So, if we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day (191) from the number of visitors on the day in question (705), we get:

Now, let's find out how many more visitors came to the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days. We know that there were 245 days between the day in question and the previous day, so if we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day (191) from the number of visitors on the day in question (514), we get:

2. She gave some of her cards to Jeff, so now she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.
3. To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards she has left from the number of Ace cards she has left.
4. So, the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards is 495 - 246 = 249.
5. Therefore, Nell has 249 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question: Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that if Jake has x peaches, Steven has x + 11 peaches.
We are also given that Jake has 17 peaches. So, if we want to find out how many peaches Steven has, we can set up the equation:
x + 11 = 17
Now, let's solve for x (the number of peaches Steven has):
x = 17 - 11
x = 6
So, Steven has 6 peaches.

Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
Thoughts:[/INST]",Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's first find the area of each room. The area of a rectangular room is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, the length and width of each room are 19 feet and 18 feet, respectively. So, the area of each room is 19 x 18 = 1624 square feet.
2. Since Jesse has 20 rooms in all, the total area of all the rooms is 20 x 1624 = 32480 square feet.
3. To find out how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the floors of all the rooms, we need to divide the total area of all the rooms by the width of the carpet. Let's assume the width of the carpet is 5 feet.
4. So, the number of square feet of carpet needed to cover the floors of all the rooms is 32480 / 5 = 6496 square feet.

1. Let's define Dean's height as ""D"" feet.
2. The depth of the water is 10 times Dean's height, so the depth of the water is 10D feet.
3. Since Dean stands at 9 feet, the depth of the water is 10D - 9 feet.
4. To find the depth of the water in feet, we need to convert 10D from feet to feet.

Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many crayons Paul had at the end of the school year. We know that he had 521 crayons initially and that he didn't lose any erasers. So, the number of crayons he had at the end of the school year is:
521 - 66 = 455
Now, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had at the beginning of the school year. We are told that he had 154 crayons left at the end of the school year, so the number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year is:
455 - 154 = 301
Now, we can find out how many crayons Paul had given away or lost by subtracting the number of crayons he had at the end of the school year from the number of crayons he had at the beginning of the school year:
301 - 154 = 147
So, Paul had given away or lost 147 crayons during the school year.

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* 89 bird families lived near the mountain.
* 60 bird families flew away for winter.
* We want to know how many more bird families flew away for winter than those that stayed behind.
2. Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer. We know that the total number of bird families that lived near the mountain is 89, and 60 of them flew away for winter. This means that the number of bird families that stayed behind is 89 - 60 = 29.
3. So, the number of more bird families that flew away for winter than those that stayed behind is 60 - 29 = 31.

Thoughts:
Let's see, if there were 41 children on the bus in total, and 2 more children got on the bus at the bus stop, then the number of children riding on the bus before the bus stop must be...
1. How many children were already on the bus when it left?
Let's assume the bus left with x children on it.
2. How many children got on the bus at the bus stop?
2 more children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus at the bus stop is x + 2.
3. How many children are there in total on the bus now?
So, the total number of children on the bus now is x + 2 + 41 = x + 43.
4. Therefore, the number of children riding on the bus before the bus stop is x.

Thoughts:[/INST]",He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 25 sacks of unripe oranges and 5 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many sacks of ripe oranges will they have after 73 days of harvest?,"
Thoughts:

* Let's assume that the number of sacks of unripe oranges remains the same throughout the 73 days of harvest.
* The total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day is 25 + 5 = 30 sacks.
* Since the oranges are harvested for 73 days, the total number of sacks of oranges harvested is 30 x 73 = 2150 sacks.
* Of these, 5 sacks are ripe oranges, so the total number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested is 5 / 30 = 0.17 sacks per day.
* To find the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 73 days, we multiply the number of sacks per day by 73: 0.17 sacks/day x 73 = 12.11 sacks.
* Therefore, after 73 days of harvest, they will have 12.11 sacks of ripe oranges.

Thoughts:[/INST]",The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Step 1: Identify the information given in the question:
* The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $87 per t-shirt sold.
* They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game.
* They sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
Step 2: Determine the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game:
* If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, and each t-shirt costs $87, then the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game is:
$47 x $87 = $4,099
Step 3: Determine the amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game:
* Since they sold a total of 95 t-shirts during both games, and they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, then they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.
* If they sold 48 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, and each t-shirt costs $87, then the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game is:
$48 x $87 = $4,396
Step 4: Find the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts:
* To find the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts, we need to add the amount made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the amount made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game:
$4,099 + $4,396 = $8,495
Step 5: Give the answer:
* Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8,495 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game.

* If she bought a total of 12 water bottles, then she has 12 - 72 = -60 bottles left.
* Since she has negative bottles, that means she has more bottles than she needs, so she will last longer than a month.
* To determine exactly how many days she will last, we need to divide the number of bottles she has by the number of bottles she drinks per day: 12 / 6 = 2 days.
So, Debby will last 2 days with the 12 water bottles she bought.

1. Let's start by using the formula for distance traveled: distance = speed x time.
2. We know the current depth of the cave is 849 feet, so we can use that as our starting point.
3. The question asks us how much farther until they reach the end of the cave, so we need to find the total depth of the cave.
4. We are given that the cave is 1218 feet deep, so we can add the current depth to the total depth to find the answer.
5. Therefore, the answer is 1218 + 849 = 2067 feet.

Thoughts:[/INST]",36 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 12 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?,"
Thoughts:
Let's break down the information given in the question:

* Initially, 36 children were riding on the bus.
* 68 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
* Some more children got on the bus.
* Afterwards, there were 12 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to subtract the number of children who got on from the number of children who got off:
Number of children who got off - Number of children who got on = More children who got off - More children who got on
We are given that 68 children got off the bus and 12 children got on the bus. So, the difference between the two numbers is:
68 - 12 = 56
Therefore, 56 more children got off the bus than those that got on.

Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question: Melissa scored a total of 21 points playing some games.
We know that she scored 7 points in each game, so we can write an equation:
21 = 7x

Where x is the number of games she played.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for x:
21 / 7 = x

x = 3

So, Melissa played 3 games.

Thoughts:[/INST]",Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had 3 bags of cans. The next day she found 7 more bags of cans and 44 bags of bottles. How many bags of cans did she have altogether?,"
Thoughts:

1. Tiffany had 3 bags of cans on Monday.
2. The next day, she found 7 more bags of cans.
3. So, the total number of bags of cans Tiffany had after finding the additional bags is 3 + 7 = 10 bags.
4. Additionally, the question states that Tiffany found 44 bags of bottles.
5. Since bottles are not the same as cans, we cannot simply add the number of bags of bottles to the number of bags of cans.
6. Instead, we need to convert the number of bags of bottles to a number of cans that is equivalent to the number of bags of bottles.
7. To do this, we can assume that each bag of bottles contains the same number of cans as a bag of bottles contains bottles.
8. So, if Tiffany found 44 bags of bottles, each bag contains 44 / 10 = 4.4 bags of cans.
9. Therefore, the total number of bags of cans that Tiffany had altogether is 10 + 4.4 = 14.4 bags.

2. Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground, so he now has x - y marbles.
3. Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has 2 + x marbles and Doug has x - y marbles.
4. We know that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed's total marbles are 2 + x - y, and Doug's total marbles are x - y.
5. We want to find out how many marbles Doug lost, so we can set up the equation:
2 + x - y = x - y + y (where y is the number of marbles Doug lost)
6. Now we can solve for y, the number of marbles Doug lost:
2 + x - y = x - y + y
x - y = 2
y = 2

So, Doug lost 2 marbles.

Thoughts:[/INST]","The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches. The mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the mouse jump?","
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to set up an equation. Let x be the distance the mouse jumped.
We know that the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped x + 9 inches.
We also know that the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped x - 3 inches.
Now, we can use the information that the grasshopper jumped 9 inches to find the value of x.
So, the equation becomes:
x + (x - 3) = 33 + 9
Simplifying the equation:
2x = 42
Dividing both sides by 2:
x = 21

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches.

Thoughts:[/INST]","The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?","
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find the distance jumped by the frog:
Frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped a total of 33 + 24 = 57 inches.
Now, let's find the distance jumped by the mouse:
Mouse jumped 5 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped a total of 57 - 5 = 52 inches.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 52 inches.

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	* Mary needs to add 12 cups of flour to the recipe.
	* She has already added 11 cups of flour.
	* The recipe calls for a total of 12 cups of flour.

* The school has 87 classrooms.
* There are 58 students in the school.
* Each classroom has the same number of students.
* There are 2 seats on each school bus.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer:

* If there are 58 students in the school and each classroom has the same number of students, then there are 58 classrooms in total.
* Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, we need to divide the total number of classrooms by 2 to find out how many buses are needed.

* There are 2 baskets of peaches.
* Each basket has 4 red peaches.
* There are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets.
* We want to find out how many green peaches are in each basket.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to solve the problem:
* Since there are 2 baskets, we can say that the total number of peaches in all baskets is 2 x 12 = 24 peaches.
* Since each basket has 4 red peaches, the total number of red peaches is 2 x 4 = 8 red peaches.
* So, the number of green peaches in each basket is 24 - 8 = 16 green peaches.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 16 green peaches in each basket.

Thoughts:
Let's first identify the information given in the question:

* There are 4 different books in the 'crazy silly school' series.
* There are 17 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.
* If you read 19 of the books, that means you have read 19/4 = 4.75 books. (Since there are 4 different books, we can round up to 5 books read)
* If you watched 7 of the movies, that means you have watched 7/17 = 0.41 movies. (Since there are 17 movies, we can round up to 1 movie watched)
Now, to find out how many more movies you still have to watch, we need to subtract the number of movies you have watched from the total number of movies:
17 - 1 = 16 movies left to watch.
So, you still have 16 movies left to watch.

Thoughts:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room.
	* Let's assume he had x action figures initially on the shelf.
2. Later he added 7 more action figures to the shelf.
	* So, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is x + 7.
3. If there are a total of 10 action figures on his shelf now, then we can set up the equation:
x + 7 = 10
4. To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
x = 10 - 7
x = 3

So, Jerry had 3 action figures initially on the shelf.

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	* Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.
	* Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially.
2. We know that Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends, so the number of crackers and cakes each friend received is the same.
3. Let's call the number of crackers and cakes each friend received x.
4. Since Matthew had 13 crackers initially, and he gave equal numbers of crackers to his friends, the number of crackers each friend received is 13/x.
5. Similarly, since Matthew had 15 cakes initially, and he gave equal numbers of cakes to his friends, the number of cakes each friend received is 15/x.
6. Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 28:
x = (13/x) + (15/x)

Thoughts:[/INST]",Jessie weighed 114 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?,"
Thoughts:

* Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	+ Jessie weighed 114 kilograms initially.
	+ She lost 50 kilograms in the first week.
	+ She lost an additional 60 kilograms in the second week.
* Now, let's calculate the total weight Jessie lost in the first two weeks:
	+ 50 kilograms + 60 kilograms = 110 kilograms
* So, after the first two weeks, Jessie weighed 110 kilograms less than her initial weight of 114 kilograms.
* To find her current weight, we need to subtract the weight she lost from her initial weight:
	+ 114 kilograms - 110 kilograms = 4 kilograms
* Therefore, Jessie weighs 4 kilograms now.

* Paul got a box of crayons for his birthday.
* By the end of the school year, he had either lost or given away 551 of them.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday.

Thoughts:
Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* Winter is almost here.
* Most animals are migrating to warmer countries.
* There are 3 bird families living near the mountain.
* 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic.
* 2 bird families flew away further south for winter.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the question:
* If most animals are migrating to warmer countries, that means that some of the bird families living near the mountain may also be migrating.
* The 26 new bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic are likely to be new families that are not migrating.
* The 2 bird families that flew away further south for winter are also likely to be migrating.
* So, the number of bird families left near the mountain after the migration is likely to be less than 3.
* Let's assume that the number of bird families left near the mountain is x.
* Since 2 bird families migrated further south, the total number of bird families that are not migrating is 3 - 2 = x - 2.
* Since 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic, the total number of bird families living near the mountain is x + 26.
* Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation: x + 26 = 3.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 23

So, there are 23 bird families left near the mountain after the migration.

Now, we need to find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park. To do this, we can divide the number of wrappers he found by the number of bottle caps he found:
