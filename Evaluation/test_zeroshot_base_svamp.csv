Thoughts:[/INST]",Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 5 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
1. Let's start by identifying the given information:
* Mary has already added 5 cups of flour.
* The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour.
* The recipe also calls for 8 cups of sugar.
* The recipe calls for 7 cups of salt.
2. Now, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add than cups of salt. Let's do this by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed:
6 cups of flour - 5 cups of flour = 1 cup of flour remaining
Now, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to add after subtracting the amount of flour remaining from the total amount of sugar needed:
8 cups of sugar - 1 cup of flour = 7 cups of sugar remaining
3. Finally, we can see that Mary needs to add 7 cups of sugar more than cups of salt to complete the recipe.
Answer: 7

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",7,1.0

Thoughts:[/INST]",Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 52 crayons to his friends while he lost 535 crayons. If he only had 492 crayons left How many crayons had been lost or given away?,"
Thoughts:
Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* Paul got a box of crayons for his birthday.
* He gave 52 crayons to his friends.
* He lost 535 crayons.
* He now has 492 crayons left.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many crayons had been lost or given away:
* If Paul had 500 crayons at first (including the ones he got for his birthday), and he gave away 52 crayons, then he had 448 crayons left (500 - 52 = 448).
* If he lost 535 crayons, then he had 933 crayons left (448 + 535 = 933).
* So, the number of crayons lost or given away is 535.
Therefore, the answer to the question is:

2. Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf.
3. He removed 7 of the old action figures from the shelf.

3. However, the waiter also got 14 new customers, so the net change in customers is 14 - 3 = 11 new customers.
4. Therefore, the waiter now has 12 + 11 = 23 customers.

Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. We know that 92 visitors came on the day after Rachel's meal, and 419 visitors came the day before that. So, if we subtract 419 from 92, we get 508 visitors on the day before Rachel's meal.
Now, let's find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace before Rachel's meal. We know that 103 visitors came on the day before that, so if we subtract 103 from 508, we get 405 visitors before Rachel's meal.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 405.

Step 1: We know that the mailman has to give 32 pieces of junk mail to each of the 55 blocks.
Step 2: We are also given that the mailman gives 8 mails to each house in a block.
Step 3: So, the total number of mails the mailman gives to each block is 32 x 8 = 256.
Step 4: Since there are 55 blocks in total, the total number of mails the mailman gives is 256 x 55 = 14,000.
Step 5: To find out how many houses are in a block, we can divide the total number of mails by the number of mails the mailman gives to each house: 14,000 / 8 = 1750 houses in a block.

* They sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.
Now, let's try to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt:
Step 1: Find the total amount of money made by the Razorback shop from selling t-shirts.
Answer: $25 x 113 = $2,825
Step 2: Find the total amount of money made by the Razorback shop from selling jerseys.
Answer: $115 x 78 = $9,028
Step 3: Find the difference between the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts and the total amount of money made from selling jerseys.
Answer: $9,028 - $2,825 = $6,203
Step 4: Divide the difference by the number of t-shirts sold to find the cost of a t-shirt.
Answer: $6,203 ÷ 113 = $55
Step 5: Divide the cost of a t-shirt by the cost of a jersey to find the difference between the two.

* The Razorback shop makes $192 dollars off each t-shirt.
* The Razorback shop makes $34 dollars off each jersey.
* They sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the difference in price between a t-shirt and a jersey.

Let's first identify the information given in the question:
* 8558 kids from Lawrence county go to camp.
* 777622 kids stay home.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and the number of kids who stayed home:

8558 / (8558 + 777622) ≈ 0.12
2. Now, let's multiply the proportion of kids who went to camp by the total number of kids to get the number of kids who stayed home:
0.12 x 8558 = 1027
Therefore, there are 1027 more kids who stayed home compared to those who went to the camp.

* Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase.
* She cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
* Now, there are 15 roses in the vase.
2. Let's count the number of roses Jessica threw away: 34.
3. Let's count the number of roses she cut from her garden: Not given in the question.
4. So, the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut from her garden is: 34 -? (where? represents the number of roses she cut from her garden).

Let's break this question down step by step:

Day 1: The ring toss game made $X dollars.
Day 2: The ring toss game made $X dollars.
Day 3: The ring toss game made $X dollars.
Day 4: The ring toss game made $X dollars.
Day 5: The ring toss game made $X dollars.
Since the total amount of money earned in 5 days is $165, we can set up the equation:
X + X + X + X + X = 165
Simplifying the equation, we get:
5X = 165
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
X = 33

Thoughts:[/INST]",Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by using the information given in the question: Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms and she lost 101 kilograms after starting to go jogging every day.
2. So, the difference between her current weight and her original weight is 101 kilograms.
3. To find her original weight, we can set up an equation using the information given in the question:
New weight - Current weight = Difference
27 kg - X kg = 101 kg

where X is her original weight.

4. Now, we can solve for X by subtracting 27 kg from both sides of the equation:
X kg = 101 kg - 27 kg
X kg = 74 kg

Therefore, Jessie weighed 74 kilograms before she started going jogging every day.

If there were 600 visitors the previous day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
1. Let's start by using the information given in the question to find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited. We know that there were 39 paintings in the palace and that 661 visitors came to the palace that day.
2. To find the total number of visitors, we can multiply the number of paintings by the number of visitors. So, the total number of visitors to the palace on that day is 39 x 661 = 25,599.
3. Now, we are asked how many more visitors visited the palace on that day than on the previous day. We know that there were 600 visitors to the palace the previous day, so we can find the difference by subtracting the previous day's visitors from the current day's visitors.
4. The difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the previous day is 25,599 - 600 = 24,999 visitors.

1. Let's count the number of tables they have: 12 sets of tables = 12 x 4 = 48 tables.
2. Now, let's count the number of chairs for each table: 14 chairs per set = 48 chairs (since they have 12 sets of tables).
3. Now, let's count the number of extra chairs: 6 chairs extra = 6 chairs.
4. So, the total number of chairs they have for the guests is: 48 chairs + 6 chairs = 54 chairs.

Thoughts:[/INST]",Frank put some pieces of candy equally into 2 bags. If he had 16 pieces of candy How many pieces of candy are in each bag?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question: Frank has 16 pieces of candy and he is equally distributing them into 2 bags.
2. We know that each bag will contain a portion of the 16 pieces of candy, so we can start by dividing the total number of pieces of candy by 2.
3. If we divide 16 by 2, we get 8. This means that each bag will contain 8 pieces of candy.
4. To confirm our answer, let's use the word ""some"" in the question to our advantage. We know that Frank put some pieces of candy into each bag, so we can assume that he put an equal number of pieces into each bag.
5. Therefore, if each bag contains 8 pieces of candy, and Frank put some pieces of candy into each bag, then each bag must contain 4 pieces of candy.

Thoughts:[/INST]",He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks how many sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days of harvest. We are given that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them.
Step 2: Identify the relevant information
We need to identify the number of days they will be harvesting oranges. In this case, it is 51 days.
Step 3: Calculate the total number of sacks of oranges harvested
We know that they harvest 74 sacks per day, so the total number of sacks of oranges harvested in 51 days is:
74 sacks/day x 51 days = 3644 sacks
Step 4: Calculate the number of sacks of oranges discarded
We are given that they discard 71 sacks of oranges per day. So, the total number of sacks of oranges discarded in 51 days is:
71 sacks/day x 51 days = 3611 sacks
Step 5: Find the total number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest
Now, we need to find the total number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest. We subtract the number of sacks discarded from the total number of sacks harvested:
Total number of sacks of oranges after 51 days = Total number of sacks harvested - Total number of sacks discarded
Total number of sacks of oranges after 51 days = 3644 - 3611 = 33 sacks
Answer: 33 sacks
Therefore, after 51 days of harvest, they will have 33 sacks of oranges.",33,153.0

* The third chapter is 25 pages long.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the difference in pages between the first and second chapters:

* The first chapter is 91 pages long, so it has 91 pages.
* The second chapter is 23 pages long, so it has 23 pages.
* The third chapter is 25 pages long, so it has 25 pages.

Now, let's subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the number of pages in the first chapter to find the difference:

91 pages - 23 pages = 68 pages

There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?
Thoughts:[/INST]",There were 106 dollars in Olivia's wallet. After she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left. If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom How much did she spend at the supermarket?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	* Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet initially.
	* After visiting a supermarket and a showroom, 26 dollars were left in her wallet.
	* She spent 49 dollars at the showroom.
2. Now, let's think about how much she spent at the supermarket:
	* If she spent 49 dollars at the showroom, and there were 26 dollars left in her wallet after visiting the supermarket, then she must have spent some amount at the supermarket as well.
	* Let's call the amount she spent at the supermarket ""x"".
3. We know that the total amount she spent is 49 + x, since she spent 49 dollars at the showroom.
4. Now, let's try to find the value of ""x"" by using the information given in the question:
	* The total amount she spent = 49 + x
	* The amount she spent at the supermarket = x
	* The amount she had in her wallet initially = 106
	* The amount she had left after visiting the supermarket = 26
	* The amount she spent at the showroom = 49

By using these equations, we can solve for ""x"" and find that she spent 23 dollars at the supermarket.

Thoughts:
Let's first count the number of roses and orchids in the vase before Jessica cut any more flowers:
6 roses + 20 orchids = 26 flowers in the vase
Now, let's count the number of roses and orchids after Jessica cut more flowers:
21 orchids + 22 roses = 43 flowers in the vase
So, there are 43 flowers in the vase now, including 22 roses and 21 orchids.
To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we can simply subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses:
22 roses - 21 orchids = 1 more rose than orchid in the vase now
Therefore, there is 1 more rose than orchid in the vase now.

	+ Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday.
	+ Julia played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday.
	+ Julia spent a total of 34 hours playing tag on both days.

	+ If Julia played with 12 kids on Monday and 14 kids on Tuesday, then the total number of kids she played with is 12 + 14 = 26 kids.
	+ Since Julia spent a total of 34 hours playing tag on both days, the average number of kids she played with per hour is 26 / 34 = 0.77 kids per hour.
	+ To find the total number of kids Julia played with altogether, we can multiply the average number of kids she played with per hour by the total number of hours she spent playing tag: 0.77 kids/hour x 34 hours = 25.8 kids.
* Therefore, the answer to the question is 25 kids.

If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day in question. We know that 705 visitors came on that day, so let's call this number ""x"".
Now, we know that there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that. Let's call these numbers ""y"" and ""z"" respectively.
We want to find out how many more visitors came to the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days. To do this, we can subtract the number of visitors on the previous day (y) from the number of visitors on the day in question (x):
x - y = number of visitors on the day in question - number of visitors on the previous day
Now, we know that x = 705, y = 191, and z = 457. So, we can plug these values into the equation:
705 - 191 = x - y
705 - 191 = 514
Now, we need to find out how many days are being considered. We know that there are 245 days in total, so we can divide the number of visitors on the day in question by the number of days being considered:
514 / 245 = number of visitors per day
So, there were 2.1 visitors per day on average at the Buckingham palace on the day in question.

Step 4: We also know that Nell had 18 Ace cards initially.
Step 5: After giving some of her cards to Jeff, Nell now has 55 Ace cards.
Step 6: So, the number of Ace cards Nell has now is 55.
Step 7: To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we need to subtract the number of Ace cards from the total number of baseball cards.

1. Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	* Baker made 155 cakes.
	* Baker's friend bought 140 cakes from him.
2. Now, let's think about how much cakes Baker would still have after his friend bought some:
	* If Baker made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140, that means Baker has 15 - 140 = -125 cakes left.
	* Wait, that can't be right! Baker can't have negative cakes! Let's try again.
	* If Baker made 155 cakes and his friend bought 140, that means Baker has 155 - 140 = 15 cakes left.

Thoughts:
Let's start by using the information given in the question: Jake has 11 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that if Jake has x peaches, Steven has x + 11 peaches.
We are also given that Jake has 17 peaches. So, if we want to find out how many peaches Steven has, we can set up the equation:
x + 11 = 17
Now, let's solve for x (the number of peaches Steven has):
x = 17 - 11
x = 6
So, Steven has 6 peaches.

Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?
Thoughts:[/INST]",Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide. If she has 20 rooms in all How much carpet does she need to cover the floors of all rooms?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's first find the area of each room. The area of a rectangular room is given by the product of its length and width. In this case, the length and width of each room are 19 feet and 18 feet, respectively. So, the area of each room is 19 x 18 = 1621 square feet.
2. Since Jesse has 20 rooms in all, the total area of all the rooms is 20 x 1621 = 32420 square feet.
3. To find out how much carpet does Jesse need to cover the floors of all the rooms, we need to divide the total area of all the rooms by the size of the carpet. Let's assume the size of the carpet is 12 feet by 12 feet (this is just an example, you can use any size you want). So, the number of square feet of carpet needed is 32420 / 12 = 2676 square feet.

Thoughts:[/INST]",Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 3 groups. Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs. How many eggs will each group have?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by dividing the total number of eggs (15) by the number of groups Rebecca wants to make (3). This gives us the total number of eggs each group will have: 15 / 3 = 5 eggs per group.
2. Now, let's see how many marbles Rebecca has (4) and how many eggs each marble can hold (since eggs are not marbles, let's just pretend). If each marble can hold 1 egg, then Rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs, which means she has 4 + 15 = 19 eggs in total.
3. Since each group will have 5 eggs, and Rebecca has 19 eggs in total, we can divide 19 by 5 to find out how many groups Rebecca can make: 19 / 5 = 3.8 groups.
4. Since we can't make a fraction of a group, we will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 groups.

Thoughts:[/INST]",Some children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 2 more children got on the bus. Then there were 41 children altogether on the bus. How many children were riding on the bus before the bus stop?,"
Thoughts:
Let's see, if there were 41 children on the bus in total, and 2 more children got on the bus at the bus stop, then the number of children riding on the bus before the bus stop must be...
1. How many children were already on the bus when it left?
Let's assume the bus left with x children on it.
2. How many children got on the bus at the bus stop?
2 more children got on the bus, so the total number of children on the bus at the bus stop is x + 2.
3. How many children are there in total now?
The total number of children on the bus now is x + 2 + 41 = x + 43.
4. So, the number of children riding on the bus before the bus stop is x.
Answer: x = 35.
Therefore, there were 35 children riding on the bus before the bus stop.",35.,39.0

Thoughts:

* Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	+ Frank read through his favorite book.
	+ The book had 2 chapters.
	+ Each chapter had 405 pages.
	+ It took Frank 664 days to finish the book.
* Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of chapters Frank read per day:
	+ If Frank read the book in 664 days, that means he read one chapter every day.
	+ Since there are 2 chapters in the book, Frank read a total of 2 x 405 = 810 pages per day.
	+ To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we can divide the number of pages he read by the number of pages in each chapter: 810 pages / 405 pages per chapter = 2.03 chapters per day.
* So, Frank read approximately 2 chapters per day.

2. We know that the number of cakes Baker sold is 145, and the number of cakes he still has is 72.
3. To find out how many cakes Baker made, we can use the information that he still has 72 cakes left. This means that he must have made at least 72 cakes.
4. Since he sold 145 cakes, we can subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he still has to find out how many cakes he made:

Now, we need to find out how much money the game made per day in the remaining 57 days. To do this, we can divide the total amount of money made by the number of days left:
439 ÷ 57 = 7.7
So, the ring toss game made approximately 7.7 dollars per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival.

Thoughts:[/INST]",The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?,"  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are my thoughts on the question:
Thoughts:
Step 1: Identify the information given in the question:
* The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $87 per t-shirt sold.
* They sold a total of 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas game and the Texas Tech game.
* They sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game.
Step 2: Determine the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game:
* Total amount of money made = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt
= 47 t-shirts x $87 per t-shirt
= $4,099
Step 3: Find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game:
* Total amount of money made = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt
= 58 t-shirts x $87 per t-shirt
= $5,262
Step 4: Find the total amount of money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during both games:
* Total amount of money made = Total amount of money made during the Arkansas game + Total amount of money made during the Texas Tech game
= $4,099 + $5,262
= $9,361
Step 5: Find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game:
* Total amount of money made = Number of t-shirts sold x Price per t-shirt
= 47 t-shirts x $87 per t-shirt
= $4,099

Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:

* Rachel had to complete 5 pages of math homework.
* Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.

Now, let's compare the number of math pages to the number of reading pages:

Math homework: 5 pages
Reading homework: 2 pages

So, Rachel had more math homework than reading homework. To find out by how many pages, we can subtract the number of reading pages from the number of math pages:

5 pages - 2 pages = 3 pages

Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

Thoughts:

1. Carol bought 6 packs of invitations, each pack has 14 invitations, so she bought a total of 6 x 14 = 84 invitations.
2. She also bought 11 extra invitations, so the total number of invitations she has is 84 + 11 = 95 invitations.
3. Since each invitation can invite multiple friends, we need to divide the total number of invitations by the number of friends each invitation can invite. Let's assume each invitation can invite 4 friends, so we divide 95 invitations by 4 = 23.75 friends.
4. Since we can't have a fraction of a friend, we round up the answer to the nearest whole number, which is 24 friends.

Thoughts:[/INST]",The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are travelling at speed of 17 How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's start by using the formula for distance traveled: distance = speed x time.
2. We know the current depth of the cave is 849 feet, so we can use that as our starting point.
3. The question asks us how much farther until they reach the end of the cave, so we need to find the total depth of the cave.
4. We are given that the cave is 1218 feet deep, so we can add the current depth to the total depth to find the end of the cave.
5. Let's convert the speed from feet per minute (ft/min) to feet per second (ft/s): 17 ft/min = 17 x 60 = 1020 ft/s.
6. Now we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. In this case, the time is the distance traveled, which is the total depth of the cave minus the current depth: distance = 1020 ft/s x (1218 ft - 849 ft) = 3682 ft.
7. Therefore, it will take them 3682 feet to reach the end of the cave.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7 to solve for x:
21 / 7 = x

x = 3

Thoughts:[/INST]",There are 8 different movies and 21 different books in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 7 of the books and watched 4 of the movies How many more movies do you still have to watch?,"
Thoughts:
Let's first identify the information given in the question:

* There are 8 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.
* There are 21 different books in the series.
* If you read 7 of the books, that means you have read 7/21 = 1/3 of the books.
* If you watched 4 of the movies, that means you have watched 4/8 = 1/2 of the movies.
Now, we need to find out how many movies you still have to watch. To do this, we need to subtract the number of movies you have watched from the total number of movies in the series:
Total movies = 8
Movies watched = 4
Number of movies still to watch = 8 - 4 = 4
So, you still have 4 movies to watch from the 'crazy silly school' series.

* There are 58 students in the school.
* Each classroom has the same number of students.
* There are 2 seats on each school bus.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer:

* If there are 87 classrooms and each classroom has the same number of students, then the total number of students in the school is 87 x 58 = 4960 students.
* Since there are 2 seats on each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by 2 to find out how many buses are needed: 4960 / 2 = 2480 buses.

* There are a total of 12 peaches in all baskets.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to solve the problem:
* Since there are 2 baskets, we can say that the total number of peaches in all baskets is 2 x 12 = 24 peaches.
* Since each basket has 4 red peaches, the total number of red peaches in all baskets is 2 x 4 = 8 red peaches.
* So, the number of green peaches in each basket is 24 - 8 = 16 green peaches.
Therefore, the answer to the question is 16 green peaches in each basket.

Let's first identify the information given in the question:

* There are 4 different books in the 'crazy silly school' series.
* There are 17 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.
* If you read 19 of the books, that means you have read 19/4 = 4.75 books. (Since there are 4 different books in total, we can round this up to 5 books read.)
* If you watched 7 of the movies, that means you have watched 7/17 = 0.41 movies. (Since there are 17 movies in total, we can round this up to 1 movie watched.)
Now, to find out how many more movies you still have to watch, we need to subtract the number of movies you have watched from the total number of movies in the series:

Thoughts:[/INST]",Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?,"
Thoughts:

1. Let's first identify the information given in the question:
	* Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.
	* Matthew had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially.
2. We know that Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends, so the number of crackers and cakes each friend received is the same.
3. Let's call the number of crackers and cakes each friend received x.
4. Since Matthew had 13 crackers initially, the number of crackers he gave to his friends is 13x.
5. Since Matthew had 15 cakes initially, the number of cakes he gave to his friends is 15x.
6. We know that the total number of crackers and cakes given to the friends is equal to the number of crackers and cakes Matthew had initially, so we can set up the equation:
13x + 15x = 13 + 15 = 28
7. Simplifying the equation, we get:
28x = 48
8. Dividing both sides of the equation by 28, we get:
x = 1.79

* Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
	+ Jessie weighed 114 kilograms initially.
	+ She lost 50 kilograms in the first week.
	+ She lost an additional 60 kilograms in the second week.
* Now, let's calculate the total weight Jessie lost in the first two weeks:
	+ 50 kilograms + 60 kilograms = 110 kilograms
* So, after the first two weeks, Jessie weighed 110 kilograms less than her initial weight of 114 kilograms.
* To find her current weight, we need to subtract the weight she lost from her initial weight:
	+ 114 kilograms - 110 kilograms = 4 kilograms
* Therefore, Jessie weighs 4 kilograms now.

Let's start by identifying the information given in the question:
* Winter is almost here.
* Most animals are migrating to warmer countries.
* There are 3 bird families living near the mountain.
* 26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic.
* 2 bird families flew away further south for winter.
Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the answer to the question. We know that 2 bird families flew away further south for winter, so there are now 3 bird families living near the mountain (the original 3 families + the 26 new families).
However, we also know that 2 bird families flew away further south for winter, which means that the total number of bird families living near the mountain has decreased by 2.
So, the number of bird families left near the mountain is:
3 (original families) - 2 (families that flew away) = 1
Therefore, there are 1 bird family left near the mountain after the migration.
