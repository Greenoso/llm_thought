      "* The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour.\n",
      "* The recipe also calls for 8 cups of sugar.\n",

      "2. Now, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add than cups of salt. Let's do this by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed:\n",
      "6 cups of flour - 5 cups of flour = 1 cup of flour remaining\n",
      "Now, we need to find out how many cups of sugar are left to add after subtracting the amount of flour remaining from the total amount of sugar needed:\n",
      "8 cups of sugar - 1 cup of flour = 7 cups of sugar remaining\n",
