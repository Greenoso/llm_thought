The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: First turn to the right. From there, you have 2 options: take 6 steps or take 4. Take 4 steps. So, the answer is No
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.2719738185405731
Total Probability for 'No': 0.7280261516571045
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: One step can be described as taking one step. 7 steps can be described as taking 7 steps. So, the answer is Yes
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.22534579038619995
Total Probability for 'No': 0.7746542692184448
The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: To face forward you should always be facing forward. When you take 4 steps forward, you should always face forward. If you take 5 steps right, you should always face right. When you take 7 steps left, you should always face left. Thus, the answer is No
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.37720251083374023
Total Probability for 'No': 0.6227974891662598
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: If you return to the starting point, you have to turn left at the first opportunity. If you turn around, you must then turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around. So, the answer is yes
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.36215052008628845
Total Probability for 'No': 0.6378495097160339
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: If you take 5 steps right, you’ll be 2 steps left of the starting point. It’s safe to take 5 steps right of the starting point. So, the answer is No
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.10451351851224899
Total Probability for 'No': 0.8954864740371704
The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: Before proceeding further, you should always face forward. After going ahead 2 steps left, and then 2 steps right, you should go back in the direction you came. From facing forward, you will take 6 steps forward, then 8 steps backward. This is how you are going to go back. So, the answer is No
