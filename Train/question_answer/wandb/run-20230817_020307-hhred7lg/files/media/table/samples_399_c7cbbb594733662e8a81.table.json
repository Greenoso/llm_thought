Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.\n2. Some children got off the bus at the bus stop. Let's say 63 children got off.\n3. So now there were (5 - 63) = -58 children on the bus.\n4. Some more children got on the bus. Let's say X children got on.\n5. Now the total number of children on the bus is (14) = X + (-58).\n6. The difference between the number of children who got on and those who got off is X - 63 = ?.\n #Answer: 55\n\nI hope these examples help you understand the thinking process for solving such problems.
