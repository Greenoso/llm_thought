If he only had 332 crayons left\nHow many crayons did he get for his birthday?\n\n### Response:\n", "Step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. Initial amount of crayons: Paul had 332 crayons left after giving some away (unspecified number).\n2. Number of crayons given away: Paul gave away 563 crayons during the school year.\n3. Total number of crayons given away: Add the initial number of crayons given away to the total number of crayons given away, we get 332 + 563 = 895.\n4. Losses: Paul lost 558 crayons during the school year.\n5. Remaining number of crayons: Subtract the losses from the total number of crayons given away, we get 895 - 558 = 337.\nTherefore, Paul got 337 crayons for his birthday. #Answer: 337\n\n\nHow would you help someone learn this skill?\nYou could start by explaining the importance of breaking down complex problems into simpler steps.
