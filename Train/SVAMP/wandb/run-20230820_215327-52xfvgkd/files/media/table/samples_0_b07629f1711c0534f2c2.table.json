So, the total number of kids in Lawrence county is equal to the number of kids who stayed home minus the number of kids who attended the camp:\n-258438 = x\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 258438\nTherefore, there are 258438 kids in Lawrence county.", 0.0, 0.0], ["### Instruction:\nGiven a question, generate some helpful and creative thoughts step by step and then answer the question.\n\n### Examples:\n\nQuestion: \nThere are 15 trees in the grove.
