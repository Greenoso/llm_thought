The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: A person taking 5 steps is a person taking 6 steps. You cannot return to the starting point when you take 4 steps. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.14264334738254547
Total Probability for 'No': 0.8573566675186157
The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: In order to return, the step needs to be repeated. The first step is to take 1 step. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.4298177659511566
Total Probability for 'No': 0.570182204246521
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: You always face forward when you take a step. This requires facing up and facing forward. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.5030031204223633
Total Probability for 'No': 0.4969968795776367
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: Turn around and turn around take 7 steps and take 8 steps. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.5713174939155579
Total Probability for 'No': 0.4286825358867645
The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: Take one step right. Take 3 steps left. Take 2 steps right. When you follow these instructions you always face forward. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.4856901168823242
Total Probability for 'No': 0.5143099427223206
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: Take 9 steps left. Immediately after that, take 2 steps left. Take 2 steps right. Immediately after that, take 6 steps forward. Immediately after that, take 10 steps backward. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.4295201301574707
Total Probability for 'No': 0.5704798698425293
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: Turn right after you take 8 steps.</s>
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.311069130897522
Total Probability for 'No': 0.6889308094978333
The qa pair is: False
&&&&&&&&: It takes 2 steps to turn right. So, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.5526716709136963
Total Probability for 'No': 0.4473283886909485
The qa pair is: True
&&&&&&&&: A person cannot take 9 steps right and take 8 steps left. Thus, the answer is
Total Probability for 'Yes': 0.21304655075073242
Total Probability for 'No': 0.7869533896446228
